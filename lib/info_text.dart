More than 20 percent of renters between ages 18 and 24 overspend their income by 100 dollars or more on a monthly basis, writes Martha C. White of Time. She cites a related statistic: that people born between 1980 and 1984 carry, on average, 5,689 dollars more of credit card debt than their parents did at their age. People in this age range are also paying off their debt at a dramatically lower rate than their parents did, meaning that many of these young people will never pay off their credit card debt. Consistent training in basic financial literacy could help alleviate much of this problem.
